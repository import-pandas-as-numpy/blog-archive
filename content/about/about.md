# Who Am I? 

My name is **Rem**, I am a malware analyst and founder of [Vipyr Security](https://vipyrsec.com), an all
volunteer open-source focused cybersecurity organization. My principle role at Vipyr Security is direction
of day to day operations, incident response, and maintenance of our organization's YARA ruleset and other
detection schemas. 

In addition to volunteering my time towards open source security, I am a supporting member of the 
Python Software Foundation, and dedicate a large portion of my time towards security of packaging ecosystems
such as the Python Package Index. 

I can also be found on [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com), where I contribute frequently towards
Cybersecurity related discussions and help steer new members towards appropriate resources, answer questions, 
and assist in internal projects. 

# Tools & Languages

I am familiar with both Linux and Windows, and largely integrate my workflow between both operating systems
as necessary.  I use a large collection of virtual machines to facilitate the handling and reversal of Malware, 
to include [Mandiant FLARE VM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) and [REMnuxÂ®](https://remnux.org/), as well as
self-built toolkits in MintOS and Ubuntu. 

Additionally, I am familiar with debuggers and decompilers/disassemblers such as [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), 
[IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/) and [Radare2](https://rada.re). I've also authored my own disassembly
toolkits to facilitate reverse engineering of specific files or executables on an ad-hoc basis. 

Most of my projects are written in Python, but I'm reasonably familiar with Java, and am currently spending a large
portion of my time learning C++, Ruby, and the odds and ends snippets of other languages as they become applicable, 
or as my interests wander.
